# meftihe.com

> Meftihe.com is a minimalistic website built with the powerful Vue.js framework, [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com). It leverages the [Jamstack approach](https://jamstack.org), ensuring lightning-fast performance and scalability by pre-rendering static content at build time. Continuous deployment through Github Actions streamlines updates and keeps the site fresh.
